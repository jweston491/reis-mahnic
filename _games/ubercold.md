A stylish parody game featuring an unconventional weapon. Team of 5. In UBERCOLD, your only means of attack is a gun with no bullets. Hurl it at your foes and control how it returns to you - losing sight of your gun leaves you defenseless. Features two modes of difficulty across 14 levels. Playthrough lasts roughly an hour. It is running in the Godot game engine. UBERCOLD is feature complete but we are working on optimization before release on Steam and itch.io. UBERCOLD will be released by Side Group. Side Group's website and more information on UBERCOLD can be found at [www.sidegroupgames.com(www.sidegroupgames.com).
